#Intro
Burning stuff is bad ! Don't do it please

Manchester is already fulll of bad stuff, don't put more in it (Peat, 2019)

Tough et al, (2016) conducted several studies in this region and found that biomass is problem for Manchester. 

Lots of people are in Manchester, using sprays to stop themselves from smelling as much, this is bad as it adds to biomass. 

#Simulations
Put a lot of people in a room and spray away!

#Results

Simulations were bad, lets hope someone will make it better in the furture
